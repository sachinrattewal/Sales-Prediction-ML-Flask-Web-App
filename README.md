# Sales-Prediction-ML-Flask-Web-App
Project Title: Sales Prediction Flask Based Web App

I have deployed my very own First Flask Based Web App, Called Sales Prediction, Which tries to predict the sales of a certain month by giving some features as Input. This project has been made By Training a machine learning-based model, on a dataset obtained From Kaggle.
The inputs are fed into the machine learning model which predicts the output and the ouptut is finally displayed on the browser using flask.
